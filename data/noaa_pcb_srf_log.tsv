.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

Light northeast winds today will result in 1 foot surf and a moderate
rip current risk along the beaches. Winds will become southwesterly on
Saturday, but still be light, before turning easterly again Sunday.
Thus, a moderate rip current risk will continue through the weekend.
Winds increase Labor Day out of the east to northeast, which could 
result in an increase in rip current risk toward the end of the 
holiday weekend.
