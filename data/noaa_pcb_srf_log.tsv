Light northeast winds today will result in 1 foot surf and a moderate
rip current risk along the beaches. Winds will become southwesterly on
Saturday, but still be light, before turning easterly again Sunday.
Thus, a moderate rip current risk will continue through the weekend.
Winds increase Labor Day out of the east to northeast, which could 
result in an increase in rip current risk toward the end of the 
holiday weekend.

A high risk of rip currents is expected for Franklin County beaches
today while a moderate risk for all other area beaches. Northeast 
winds around high pressure to the north continues for the next several
days. Late afternoon and overnight offshore surges will drive up the 
surf at Franklin County beaches with surf heights approaching 3 feet 
today. Dangerous rip and longshore currents will affect Apalachee Bay

.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

As northeast winds continue through Wednesday and overnight offshore
surges through Apalachee Bay drive up surf along Franklin county
beaches, a high risk of rip currents will continue. For the other
local beaches, a moderate risk of rip current is expected. Rain will
be hard to come by as dry air remains in place leading to partly to
mostly skies. Winds are expected to shift to the southwest after mid
week which should allow the rip current risk at Franklin County
beaches to become moderate, as well as for the other local beaches.

.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

Northeast offshore winds will persist today and throughout the week
ahead, limiting the rip current risk at Emerald Coast beaches in the
Moderate category. In contrast, Franklin County beaches will be a
little more exposed the the surf generated by northeast winds, so
2-foot surf there will lead to periods of Moderate and High risk, with
risk generally peaking during the morning hours, then fading in the
afternoon hours.

.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

Northeast offshore winds will persist today and throughout the rest of
the week, limiting the rip current risk at Emerald Coast beaches in 
the Moderate category. In contrast, Franklin County beaches will be a 
little more exposed to the the surf generated by northeast winds, so 
2 to 3-foot surf there will lead to periods of Moderate and High 
risk, with risk generally peaking during the morning hours, then 
fading in the afternoon hours.

Surf Zone Forecast

343 AM EDT Tue Sep 16 2025

.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

Gentle to occasionally moderate northeast and easterly breezes will
prevail over the northeast Gulf through this weekend. Afternoon
seabreezes will develop each day at the beaches. So the benign
conditions will keep surf heights at only about 1 foot, perhaps 2 feet
at times for Franklin Count beaches. These conditions will hold rip
current risk in the low to moderate ranges.

There is a high risk of rip currents for most of our beaches today.
Strong east to east-southeast winds and 2 to 3 foot surf will bring
another day of dangerous rip currents to area beaches today except for west-
facing beaches in Gulf County and the St. Joseph Peninsula State Park
beaches where winds will be offshore. This pattern persists Monday 
before relaxing Tuesday through Thursday. However, with prevailing 
easterly winds, Franklin County beaches will likely have a high rip
current risk through much of the week.

.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

A high rip current risk continues for Walton, south-facing Gulf, and
Franklin County beaches today. Breezy easterly winds and 2 to 3 foot
surf will continue along the beaches today. The exception will be Bay
County beaches and west-facing and state park beaches of Gulf County
where winds will be offshore and surf will be 1 to 2 feet. Winds
decrease over the next few days, but the onshore flow will likely mean
the high risk of rip currents will continue for Franklin County
beaches through the end of the week.

The strong easterly flow regime the region has been under will let up
today and with residual swell in the water we'll see at least one more
day of high rip current risks at Walton and south facing beaches of
Gulf and Franklin counties. This weakening flow should allow a
moderate risk of rip currents at area beaches on Wednesday and
Thursday. Mostly dry conditions are expected but a few isolated

Rip current risk will confidently remain low to moderate through
Thursday. On Friday and Saturday, gentle to moderate southeast and
south breezes over the Gulf will start increase the surf, but surf
should still remain low enough to only warrant a moderate risk of rip

.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

Rip current risk through Thursday will remain confidently in the low 
to moderate range. 

On Friday and Saturday, gentle to perhaps moderate southeast breezes 
over the Gulf waters will become south and then southwest. This will 
push an increase in surf onto area beaches, but it is most likely to 
remain just below the threshold for high risk. 

Then on Sunday, westerly winds will increase in advance of a strong 
and abrupt cold front. A high risk of rip currents will develop for 
the more westerly- exposed beaches of Bay and Gulf Counties, though a 
brief time of high risk is possible for Walton County beaches too.

A persistent moderate onshore flow will make for a moderate risk of 
rip currents at all local beaches the next couple of days. By 
Wednesday, a cold front ushers brisk westerly winds, which look to 
induce a high risk at St Joseph Peninsula west-facing beaches in Gulf

post-frontal winds on Thanksgiving Day maintain a high risk at Gulf 
County where a formidable longshore flow develops.

.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS AT WALTON AND BAY COUNTY BEACHES THIS 
AFTERNOON...

An increase in southerly winds ahead of an approaching cold front 
pushes surf heights up to 3 ft at the Panhandle beaches this 
afternoon, so a high risk of rip currents is anticipated by then and 
persists through Wednesday. By Thanksgiving Day, strong post-frontal 
northerly winds prompt a high risk of rip currents at St Joseph 
peninsula beaches where a formidable longshore flow develops and 
continues through Black Friday. A moderate risk appears to hold firm 
at St George Island beaches until this weekend.

Strong southerly breezes this morning over the offshore waters will
kick up the surf today and bring a high risk of rip currents.
Conditions will quickly improve late tonight, as winds turn northerly
offshore, with only a moderate risk of rip currents on Wednesday and
Thursday. Southerly winds over the offshore waters will again kick up
the surf and the risk of rip currents on Friday and Saturday.

A southerly swell will result in surf heights up to 3 
feet along the Walton, Bay, and Gulf County beaches 
today, resulting in a high rip current risk. The high

of Gulf County, where it may need to be extended if
confidence increases. Otherwise, a moderate risk of

.THE SURF ZONE FORECAST GENERAL OUTLOOK...

A moderate risk for rip currents is expected at the area beaches
today. The next low pressure system will affect the area Thursday and
Friday. This will drive the surf heights up with an increase to a high
risk of rip currents at all beaches. The high risk will continue into
Saturday as surf heights remain elevated. Towards the latter half of
the weekend, surf heights decrease as well as the rip current risk
back to a more moderate level.

...HIGH RISK OF RIP CURRENTS CONTINUE AT GULF COUNTY BEACHES...

Strong post-frontal longshore flow maintains a high risk of rip 
currents at Gulf County beaches today. As the week progresses, winds 
gradually shift out of the west, thus producing an onshore flow at Bay
& Gulf County beaches. A moderate to high risk is forecast for those 
zones. By Saturday, a more widespread high risk is anticipated ahead 
of the next weather system.
